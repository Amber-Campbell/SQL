# For this project, I pulled sample data from Kaggle to create a table. 
# I imported the .csv file data into the table using SQLiteStudio.
# Finally, I performed queries and analytics on the data using SQL.

# First I checked that the data had imported correctly from the file
SELECT * from BIT_DB.Spotifydata;
# Next I queried how many unique artists are on the list.
SELECT distinct artist_name FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

# Then I ordered the duration of all tracks from the dataset in descending order 
SELECT artist_name, track_name, duration_ms FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata

# Finally, I queried which were the Top 10 artists and with which track they made that position
